Rainboard Lightning Spec





* Two versions of product will use same PCB: 

  Lightning:
    61 performance buttons (the buttons on top of unit)
    61 RGB LEDs (one LED under each button)
    12 meta-buttons (buttons on sides)
    2 softpots 
    2 MIDI DINs
    DC power input
    Sustain pedal in  
    Foot controller in
    Control Voltage out

  Thunder:
    61 main keys (RGB lEDs left unpopulated)
    USB only
    no external power supply




Take existing PCB and improve:

* Integrate Arduino Mega onto PCB.

* Implement input multiplexing (maybe remove IO expander if unnecessary).


* 61 LEDS and bypass caps.

* Power supply capable of powering 61 LEDS and Arduino, efficiently.

* When unit is powered with USB only, should still function, but without lights.


* move meta-button from front-sides to rear-sides.

* engage programmer mode with meta buttons (or other solution).

* add 220 ohm Resistor to each button positive (for static discharge protection)?

* Redesign back panel for better aesthetic design.
